    <h4>Pros</h4>

    <p class="text-justify">

            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cavalcanti.samuel.findbycolor2&hl=en_US">findByColor</a>,
        so i'm newbyte about android and this Track surprese me in a good way.
        I never hear about <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview">RecyclerView</a>
        or <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room">android Room</a> its awesome learn things extremely
        useful.
