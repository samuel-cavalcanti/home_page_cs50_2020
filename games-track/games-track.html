    <h4>Pros</h4>

    <p class="text-justify">
      I never programing in lua and it nice to know how easy is create a game with <a href="https://love2d.org/">love</a> S2.
      I feel of all the Tracks games is the most easy, i just add 5 lines of code and complete the first submit and the second
      i start to refatore all code because e not want to finish, because it's nice to make things moving in screen, but everything
      needs to end, so i start to refatore the first submit :D. I search and implement the the original songs of pong game, and see
      in to internet a design Pattern call Subject and Observer and again start to refatore using the design pattern the result is:
      <a href="https://github.com/samuel-cavalcanti/pongGame">pong game repository</a>
    </p>

    <h4>coins</h4>

      the same problem of dirty code of android track, its possible start a programing with a clean way ?
